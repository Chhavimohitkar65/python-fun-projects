- 🧮 **Voice Calculator with pyttsx3**

## 🔴 Connect 4 Game using Minimax Algorithm and Pygame

### Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the classic **Connect 4** game 🎮. Play against an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax Algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning to simulate intelligent decision-making.

### Features
- 👤 **Single Player Mode**: Play as Player 1 against the AI (Player 2).
- 🤖 **AI Opponent**: The AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to determine the best moves.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Gameplay**: Visualized using the `pygame` library.
- 🎯 **AI Strategy**: Alpha-beta pruning optimizes the decision-making process, ensuring efficient gameplay.

### Libraries Used
- `pygame` 🎮: For creating the game window and rendering the game board.
- `numpy` 🔢: For efficient array manipulations.
- `math` ➗: For handling game calculations.

### How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy
2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python connect4.py
Enjoy the game! 🕹️

# 🧮 Voice Calculator with pyttsx3

## Overview
This project is a **Voice Calculator** that takes basic mathematical input from the user via text and provides voice feedback using the `pyttsx3` library 🔊. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and modulus.

## Features
- 🎤 **Voice Interaction**: The calculator interacts with the user via voice.
- ➕ **Basic Operations**: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and modulus.
- 👤 **Personalized Experience**: Prompts the user for their name and reads the result aloud.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech**: Uses `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech conversion.

## Libraries Used
- `pyttsx3` 🔊: For text-to-speech conversion.

## How to Run
1. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python voice_calculator.py
3. Start calculating with voice responses! 🧠
